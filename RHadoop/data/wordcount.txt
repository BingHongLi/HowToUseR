Two purported ISIS fighters interviewed for a news agency working in ISIS-held territory have given the same reason for the militants retreat from the Syrian city of Kobani the constant pummeling by coalition airstrikes On Monday Kurdish fighters declared that they had released the city on the border to Turkey from ISIS grip after 112 days of fighting The efforts of the Kurdish fighters known as the YPG or People Protection Units on the ground were backed by an extensive campaign of airstrikes by the US led international coalition against ISIS
And according to the interviews given to ISIS aligned Amak news agency in Syria it was those airstrikes that won the battle for Kobani referred to by the fighters as Ayn Al Islam
Recently we have withdrawn from Ayn Al Islam bit by bit because of the airstrikes and deaths of a number of our brothers said one of the two fighters his face covered apart from his eyes
He points to a scene of destruction behind him but vows that ISIS will persist and this is the message we send to Obama
The second fighter interviewed by Amak stood near a road sign reading Ayn Al Islam He said ISIS forces had raided 360 villages around Kobani from which the people ran away like rats
But the reason behind their withdrawal from the city he said is that we no longer had places to hold there We were inside Ayn Al Islam and we occupied more than 70% but the airstrikes did not leave any building standing they destroyed everything
I swear by God their planes did not leave the air day and night they did airstrikes all day and night They targeted everything They even attacked motorcycles they have not left a building standing But by God willing we will return and we will have our revenge multiplied
